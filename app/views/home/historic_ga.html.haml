      Set in the latter 40s of the 20th century, this committee
      represents a world still reeling from the devastating
      effects of the greatest war in recorded human history.
      Throughout this time, the Middle East has been on
      tenterhooks. The immigration of Jews to the land they
      believe is theirs by right of religion, precipitated by the
      fall of the Ottomans and greatly accelerated due to
      ruthless persecution by the Nazis, has inflamed the Arab
      majority that resides there. The Jews, for their part,
      have suffered immeasurably, right from the misdirection
      portrayed by the Balfour Declaration to the fiasco with
      the Exodus ship. The British have interfered in the
      matters of this region for quite a while, and now things
      start to be ripping at the seams. Riots and hostilities are a
      present concern. Amidst this turmoil, the United Nations
      General Assembly has come to session to prevent this
      situation from escalating into another full-scale war. Do
      keep reading if you want to be part of a chance to, quite
      possibly, rewrite world history.
