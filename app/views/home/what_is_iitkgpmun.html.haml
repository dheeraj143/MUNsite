      IIT KGP MUN aspires for the youth to be socially aware, to
      develop a deep insight into the world's problems, to create
      awareness of the causes of conflict between nations and to lead
      them to a better understanding of the interests and motivation of
      others. IITKGP MUN therefore humbly attempts to fulfil the goals
      set by the founding fathers of the United Nations, as drafted in
      the Preamble charter:

        “To practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another
        as good neighbours.”
